**The `execute` method signature.**

The `CommandProcessor` has a single asynchronous `execute` method. This is an overloaded method with 4 signatures, but has a single implementation using conditional types to determine which arguments are required at the call site.

```ts
import {Observable} from "rxjs";

export class CommandProcessor {

    execute(commandGroup, input): Observable<IOType>
    execute(commandGroup, input, extraArgs): Observable<IOType>
    execute(commandGroup, input, bypassCondition): Observable<IOType|BypassType>
    execute(commandGroup, input, extraArgs, bypassCondition): Observable<IOType|BypassType> {
        
    }
}
```

The first two arguments are always required:

- `commandGroup: CommandGroup`
- `input` - the type of this argument is inferred from the `CommandGroup`'s `IOType`

Any other required arguments are determined by inspecting the supplied `CommandGroup`:

- `extraArgs` - required if the `CommandGroup` specifies an `ExtraArgsType`. Its type is a predetermined length tuple exposing element labels and types.
- `bypassCondition: CommandProcessorBypassCondition` - this is required if the `CommandGroup` specifies an `AdditionalOutputType`. It's a type guard function that is executed to test the current return type, bypassing the remaining commands if it's found to be the same type as the groups `AdditionalOutputType`.
