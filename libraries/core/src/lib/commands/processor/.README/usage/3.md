**When a command has an additional output type.**

```ts
import {take} from 'rxjs/operators'
import {Command, CommandGroup, CommandProcessor, CommandProcessorBypassCondition} from 'commands';


const group = new CommandGroup<Command<number, number | string>, true>(),
    processor = new CommandProcessor(),
    bypassCondition: CommandProcessorBypassCondition<number, string> = (inpt: number|string): inpt is string => {
        return typeof inpt === 'string';
    };

group.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand());
group.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand());
group.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand());

// 3rd argument of type CommandProcessorBypassCondition is now required as the CommandGroup has an additional output type
processor.execute(group, 1, bypassCondition) 
    .pipe(take(1))
    .subscribe((output: number | string) => {
        // output: 4
    });

processor.execute(group, 3, bypassCondition)
    .pipe(take(1))
    .subscribe((output: number | string) => {
        // output: 'larger than 5'
        // 3rd Command in group bypassed
    });
```
