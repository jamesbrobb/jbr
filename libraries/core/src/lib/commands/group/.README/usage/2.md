**Command group creation**

A command type must be specified for the first type parameter of the `CommandGroup` on creation. If not an error occurs when attempting to add commands to the group.

```ts
const badGroup = new CommandGroup();
badGroup.addCommand(new StringInStringOutCommand()); // Error - A type is required for the CommandGroup CommandType type variable

const goodGroup = new CommandGroup<Command<string>>();
goodGroup.addCommand(new StringInStringOutCommand()); // ok
```

The supplied command type must have a common input and output type to ensure commands can be safely executed sequentially.


```ts
const badGroup = new CommandGroup<Command<string, number>>();
badGroup.addCommand(new StringInStringOutCommand()); // Error - The CommandGroup CommandType type variable has an Input and Output type mismatch

const goodGroup = new CommandGroup<StringInStringOutCommand>();
goodGroup.addCommand(new StringInStringOutCommand()); // ok - string
```

If the supplied command has a common IO type but also an additional output type, it must be explicitly flagged that this is allowed


```ts
const badGroup = new CommandGroup<Command<number, number|string>>();
badGroup.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand()); // Error - The CommandGroup CommandType has an additional output type, but the AllowNonMatchingOutputType type parameter was not explicitly set to true

const goodGroup = new CommandGroup<Command<number, number|string>, true>();
goodGroup.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand()); // ok - string | number

```
