**Command Compatibility within a CommandGroup**

The following types are calculated from the command type assigned to the group:

- a common IO type - this is determined by extracting the input type from the output type
- an additional output type - this is determined by excluding the IO type from the output type
- any additional argument types in its `execute` method - i.e `execute(input: string, arg1: number, arg2: Function): string // [arg1:number, arg2:Function]`


When attempting to add a command to the group the corresponding types are inferred from the command to test its compatibility.


A command's common **IO type** is compatible if:

- it's an exact match to the group IO type
- once the group additional output type is excluded from the commands IO type, the result is an exact match to the group IO type
- it's a subtype of the group IO type when compared through a non-distributive conditional type, and its input type is an exact match to the group IO type

A command's **Additional output type** is compatible if:

- it's `never`
- it's an exact match with the group additional output type
- it's a subtype of the group's additional output type when compared through a non-distributive conditional type

A command's **Extra arguments** are compatible if:

- it has none
- they're an exact match with the group
- it has fewer than the group, but the types match sequentially
