**Adding Commands to a CommandGroup**

Once a command type is set on a group any attempt to add a non-compatible command will result in one of the following errors:

- IO type of `CommandGroup` and supplied command do not match
- `CommandGroup` additional output type is `never` but the supplied commands additional output type has a type set
- `CommandGroup` and supplied commands additional output type do not match
- `CommandGroup` and supplied commands extra arguments do not match

```ts

const group1 = new CommandGroup<Command<number>>();

group1.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOutCommand()); // OK
group1.addCommand(new StringInStringOutCommand()); // Error - IO type of CommandGroup and supplied commands do not match
group1.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand()) // Error - additional output type is `never` but the supplied commands additional output type has a type set
group1.addCommand(new CommandWithExtraArguments()) // Error - the supplied commands extra arguments do not match

const group2 = new CommandGroup<Command<number, number|string>>();

group2.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrStringOutCommand()); // OK
group2.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOrBooleanOutCommand()); // Error - supplied commands additional output type do not match

const group3 = new CommandGroup<Command<number, number, [string, Function]>>();

group3.addCommand(new CommandWithExtraArguments()) // OK
group3.addCommand(new NumberInNumberOutCommand()) // OK - IO matches and has no extra args
```
